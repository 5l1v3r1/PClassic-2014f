# Purpose

I am preparing for the 2014 fall [PClassic](http://pclassic.org) competition by implementing some useful math utilities in Java. Some of the stuff I'm implementing would have really come in handy [last year](https://github.com/unixpickle/PClassic-2013f).

# What's included

So far, I have created APIs for the following:

 * Math
   * GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).
   * Vector2
     * Dot products; magnitudes; subtraction and addition
     * Vector projection

# TODO:

 * Math
   * LCM (Least common multiple)
   * EEA (Extended Euclidean Algorithm)
   * Polynomial root finder
   * Primitive bigints
   * Linear system of equation solver
   * 3D vector utilities
   * Polynomial containment; triangle containment
   * Primality test
   * Factorizor
 * Parsing
   * Roman numerals
   * Polynomials
 * Algorithms
   * Breadth-first search
   * Depth-first search
   * Levenshtein distance
